# System Capacity Planning
### This implementation of simulation is based on SIMPY which is an open-source package of Python.
### SIMPY is very handy for queue problem and easy to use.

If you are a student of COMP9334 of UNSW as I am, you may refer to the spec.pdf first to check what the project is about.

A simple tutorial code in given in simpy_tutorial.py, please check it out with manual of SIMPY. It should be easy to get your hand on if you has experience with Python. All figures are generated by matplotlib.pyplot of Python and if you are new with it, check the tutorial of it online. An alternative way is to use Seaborn(https://seaborn.pydata.org/).

### Remember to verify the time distribution of arrival jobs and service before you start the experience
